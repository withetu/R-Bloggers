# Start with daily data. Note that "type = raw" will download a data frame.
oil_daily <- Quandl("FRED/DCOILWTICO", type = "raw", collapse = "daily", start_date="2006-01-01", end_date="2017-02-28")

# Now weekely and let's use xts as the type.
oil_weekly <- Quandl("FRED/DCOILWTICO", type = "xts", collapse = "weekly", start_date="2006-01-01", end_date="2017-02-28")

# And monthly using xts as the type.

# Have a quick look at our three  objects.

# let’s use the seq() function and mdy() from the lubridate package to put the date into a nicer format.

# The data we want is now housed in its own dataframe. Let’s convert that to an xts object.

# Now we can combine the historical xts object with the forecasted xts object using cbind().
oil_combined_xts <- cbind(oil_monthly, oil_forecast_xts)

# Add a nicer name for the first column.
colnames(oil_combined_xts)[1] <- "Actual"

# Have a look at both the head and the tail of our new xts object. Make sure the
# NAs are correct.

# dygraph provides a nice way to plot our actual time series versus our three forecasted time series because it simply does not plot the NAs.
dygraph(oil_combined_xts, main = "Oil Prices: Historical and Forecast") %>%
  # Add the actual series
  dySeries("Actual", label = "Actual") %>%
  # Add the three forecasted series
